Codecademy project at end of "improved styling with CSS" section. Practicing Colors, Typography, The Box Model, Display&amp;Positioning.

## Things to work on
Judging from the solution example I need to work on semantic class naming. Basically semantic CSS. I don't have descriptive and module class names. Here are two sites on the subject I can refer to in the future.

* https://css-tricks.com/semantic-class-names/
* https://maintainablecss.com/chapters/semantics/
* And finally, a more practicle referance for semantic CSS is just to view the solution to this project. The solution can be found in the solution folder.
